    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I am a recently discharged Air Force veteran with <b>nearly 10 years of service</b> who is working on his 
    <em>Technical Certificate in Software Development.</em> I did 6 years active duty and a little over 3 years full time in the Idaho Air National Guard. 
    My job in the Air Force was Security Forces. The responsibilities of Security Forces include law enforcement, base security, and expeditionary combat operations in deployed environments. 
    During my time in the Air Force, I traveled to well over a dozen countries/locations, was stationed at 3 duty locations, and served 1 combat deployment to the horn of Africa. </p>

    <p>I have always been into tech, and from an early age I was gaming and working on computers. 
    Computers have always been interesting to me and I loved taking them apart and fixing them as a teenager. 
    When I left the Air Force I decided to try something new, which led me to the CWI Software Development course. </p>

    <p>I have now finished learning C# in school and am now learning HTML and CSS. I look forward to 
        seeing how much I learn and trying my hardest to excel in this new section of the Software 
        Development course. </p>
